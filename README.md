# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Bias

The objective of this project is to assess the impact of algorithm bias on machine learning algorithms trained with imbalanced data. 
Here, I have used the datasets cancer and fraud.csv(which has a huge majority bias) and then used SMOTE strategy for overcoming this bias.
